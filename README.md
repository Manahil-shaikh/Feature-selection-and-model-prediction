Feature-selection-and-model-prediction
------------------------------------------------
In this project, the UNET MODEL is trained on Kidney kits 19 dataset. The model is also modified to reduce the computaional cost. The densefull file contains UNET model modified to include 5 encoders and 5 decoders with lesser number of filters so that the computaional cost of the model is reduced.
The code for creating the model.h5 file and predictions is also given.
The file feature-selection-dataset contains the code for applying feature selection technqiue using the openCV library and generating the dataset of the feature selected images.
