Feature-selection-and-model-prediction

Feature selection techniques like HSV,Thresholding and canny edge detection have been applied on the images and dataset has been generated for each image. The incresed-depth unet model has been trained on these dataset

The densefull file contains UNET model modified to include 5 encoders and 5 decoders with lesser number of filters so that the computaional cost of the model is reduced.
